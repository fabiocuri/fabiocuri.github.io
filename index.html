          <p style="margin-right:10px;text-align:justify;">This is a tiktok a came across some weeks ago, the dancing captivated me so much I couldn't forget about it, then some days ago the song was eating my insides, I hadn't watch the video in a while because I uninstall tiktok, so I urged one of my friends to look it up for me.<br>From what I learned, this is a Polish dance called Oberek, that would be translated to something like "to spin"; it's a very lively dance that has a lot of different dance moves, this one with the knees being one of them.<br>What called my attention the most was the fact that the women in the dance lift the entire body weight of the men in certain moves, it's really impressive!</p>
